Moreover, the training offer is very segregated and concentrated mainly in the sciences and applied sciences.</p><p>Finally, a survey we conducted among a sample of students revealed that more than 87% of them would like to be trained in these issues.</p><p>In view of this observation, we propose avenues of reflection to support the transition and adaptation of higher education training.</p><p><div class='buttons-container'><div><a class='btn btn-super-accent btn-lg' href='/education4climate_rapport_final_fr.pdf'>Download the report</a><div class='subtitle'>For the moment only available in <a href='/education4climate_rapport_final_fr.pdf'>French</a> and <a href='/education4climate_rapport_final_nl.pdf'>Dutch</a>, an English version will soon be available.</div></div></div></p>",
