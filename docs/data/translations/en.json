    "home-text": "<p>Welcome to Education4Climate, the web-application that enables you to search for University and High School courses or programmes on climate & environmental sustainability and professors with teaching expertise in these fields. </p><h2>Our vision and goals</h2><p>Environmental sustainability has become a major concern for all citizens and for youths, in particular. The transition into a CO<sub>2</sub> neutral society toward 2050 decided by the European Union is a major step in favour of the climate and our environment, which not only requires massive investments and changes in the fields of industry, services or infrastructure, but also human intelligence, skills and competences, to drive the ecological transition.</p><p>If education is key for sustainability, from child to adults, Universities and High Schools play a particular role, since they educate most of the decisions makers, key players and experts of our community. Education4Climate aims at promoting education on climate and environmental sustainability in Universities and High Schools by facilitating access to information on the programmes and courses that tackle these topics. </p><p>Education4Climate will help future students to select the programme or University/High School which best address their aspirations, and programmes manager will find a very useful to monitor, confront and improve their education programmes. Lastly, Education4Climate offers an easy access to identify professors with proven teaching expertise on climate and environmental sustainability, a first step toward efficient knowledge sharing and community building. </p><h2>How does it work ? </h2><p>The application crawls the universities websites and uses a simple natural language algorithm to identify the courses that explicitly cover climate and environmental sustainability. A more detailed description of our methodology can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/DeLeb86/unicrawl/blob/master/src/score/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p><p>Programmes, courses and professors can be filtered by: universities, themes and fields. The fields covers what is classically known as ‘Faculty’, which have often various names, depending on the university. High Schools are not yet covered at the moment, and will be implemented by the end of 2021. </p><h2>Who are we ? </h2><p> Education4Climate is driven by the Shifters Belgium, with the support of the Belgian branch of the <a href=\"https://www.unsdsn.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SDSN</a>, <a href=\"https://theshift.be\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Shift</a> and <a href=\"https://theshiftproject.org\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Shift Project</a>. </p><h2>How to Contribute ? </h2><p>There are several ways you can contribute to Education4Climate:</p><h3>Share your voice</h3><p>You are a student, or a professor ?
